The datasets include data from almost all countries worldwide, with a few exceptions such as Greenland, Turkmenistan and North Korea. Both datasets share the same structure, consisting of columns like country names and codes, years, the specific topic and a binary indicator of its presence (1 = yes, 0 = no).\n"

    "Since both datasets contained many columns with only missing data, we removed these columns. They were supposed to include information on definitions or general comments. For our analysis, removing these columns has no negative effect. In addition, the datasets contain a large amount of data related to topics that are not relevant to our analysis, such as water supply or mobile payments. All unnecessary data is removed from the datasets. To combine both topics of interest, the datasets were merged. Before this could be done, the column names of the binary outcomes were first renamed to reflect the corresponding topic and a selection was made of the columns to be analyzed. After merging the datasets, the resulting dataset contains 5 columns and 10,206 rows."
